*Intransitives are known to fall into two classes, unergatives and unac-cusatives, associated with a wide range of diverging properties. It has long been argued that the semantics of a given verb determines whether it will preferentially exhibit unergative or unaccusative behavior. In particular, agentive semantics has been associated with unergativity, telic semantics with unaccusativity. In this paper, we test this claim empirically using corpus data from Hindi. For a wide range of intransitives, we compute how often they take an animate argument and how often they combine with a telic light verb. The results offer some support for the effect of agentivity and telicity on the syntax of intransitives, but are too limited in scope to allow for reliable conclusions. We end by discussing the methodological challenges of establishing the semantic correlates of split intransitivity.*

*Complex numerals combine via addition and multiplication in the syntax from a sequence of simplex numerals. In this paper, we investigate a novel class of numerals labeled ‘and-a-half’ numerals which can combine with simplex numerals via addition resulting in a simplex numeral. But across languages, the presence of ‘and-a-half’ limits the formation of complex numerals to only via multiplication. Further addition of another numeral in this structure considerably degrades the construction. This paper focuses on Hindi data and seeks to explain this restriction placed by ‘and-a-half’ by investigating its pragmatic role in setting standards of precision. The analysis presented here predicts that the planning component in communicating standards of precision is encoded at the phrasal level where once you set a low standard of precision you cannot arbitrarily raise it - which is exactly what happens when an additive component is introduced in the structure.*
