## How to say my name

In Marathi, it is [ʃəʊ.'nək fəɖ.'ɳis] which is hard for most people. I prefer the Hindi pronunciation of my name which is /ʃɔ.'nək/ as it is the one I have heard more often in my life than the actual pronunciation at this point. Even though the right pronunciation of my last name is /phəɖ.ɳis/, I very strongly prefer the fricative over the plosive. 

## Languages

As is common for Indian folks, I grew up speaking three languages - Marathi (native), Hindi (near-native), English (professional fluency). I can sort of understand conversational Bangla. I once successfully bargained in Bangla with an auto rikshaw guy at New Jalpaiguri railway station. I have lost that ability now. 

## Hobbies

In my free time I like to read comic books, cook delicious meals, discover obscure music, and watch Jiminy Glick. I also write [music](https://falseflagindia.bandcamp.com/) - I really really like odd-time signatures. I love watermelons and prefer bowls over plates.
