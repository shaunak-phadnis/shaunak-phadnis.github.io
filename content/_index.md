# Hello — I’m Shaunak 👋
 
<img src="/images/profile.jpeg" width="250" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;">

I am a 3rd year PhD student at the [department of linguistics at UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/). I mainly work in Formal Pragmatics which is ideal because I find communication confusing and fascinating. I like to think about how speakers are able to communicate various messages/signals/intentions without actually stating them explicitly. Due to this, I also like to think about Social Meaning and Philosophy of Langauge. I also have a latent interest in how events are represented in our cognitive architecture and how different modules are cognition interface with linguistic processing. 

Before coming to UMass I worked as a Conversational UX designer at a start-up.
