# Hello — I’m Shaunak 👋
 
<img src="/images/profile.jpeg" width="250" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;">

I am a 3rd year PhD student at the [Department of Linguistics at UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/). Before coming to UMass I worked as a Conversational UX designer at a start-up in India. 

Broadly, I am interested in understanding how conversations work - how speakers navigate and communicate implicit meaning through their responses in a discourse.
More specifically, I am interested in:
 - Representation of not-at-issue meaning and structure of the context and common ground. 
 - How strategies of rejection, denial, and disagreement are encoded across langauges and what the building blocks for them are.
 - Off-record communication and signaling strategies (Insinuations, Dogwhistles, Two-tracked conversations)
 - Discourse particles in South Asian languages and discursive strategies they conventionalize.

Thus, this grounds my research in Formal Pragmatics and its interface with Semantics on one hand and Social meaning/Philosophy of Language on the other. Apart from this, I also like thinking about Syntax, specifically:
- Adverbial agreement in Indo-Aryan.
- Person agreement in Marathi.

I have a latent fascination with representation of event structures in cognition.
